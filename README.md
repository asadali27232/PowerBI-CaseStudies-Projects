# PowerBI-CaseStudies-Projects
Showcasing real-world case studies and projects that demonstrate the application of Power BI in data analysis and visualization

## Motive
Mastering my Power BI skills by working on real-world projects. I’ll be working as an analyst for various (fictitious) companies to help generate strategic insights. Using what I’ve learned from courses in the [Data Analyst in Power BI track at DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/), I’ll help companies to perform exploratory data analysis and guide leadership to make the correct decisions.
I’ll use Power Query to investigate and clean the data to find insights, leverage DAX to create data models, develop new insights, and use my data visualization skills to create beautiful dashboards and reports. I'll pick a case study of my favorite industry and have fun!
